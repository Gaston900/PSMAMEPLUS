What is PSMAME PLUS?

This is a special edition of the Shadow Project emulator, which uses the HBMAME emulator source code.

The beginning of this project was in 2019, where I offer users the pleasure of being able to play all the franchises of the Metal Slug games of the "Neo Geo MVS" arcade system.

It will also include unofficial versions known as "hacks".

In order to compile successfully we will need the source codes of HBMAME version 0.215.

Please note that the use of this emulator is prohibited for any commercial use or used the project for an economic fundraiser.
