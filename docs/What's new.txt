2022-10-XX

- I make this section to thank Robert enormously, who has made a great effort to help me program these codes, 
  so that this version could be published today, the most important news that was now applied by default in 
  all the Metal Slug franchises. Every time you start a boot game you will have level 8 + blood mode, you no 
  longer have to set manually using SOF DIT NEOGEO.

  with the laser weapon that does not work in the water levels that are very annoying in Metal Slug 3.

  the .P1 and P2 roms in their respective places.

  which has been included in HBMAME around 8 years ago, this rom hacks have a very serious 
  problem that generates a crash in mission 2 / phase 2 and phase 3 , its way of manifesting 
  is to make the torso disappear from the body that if the button is pressed shooting, the game 
  crashes immediately and will restart the game from scratch and will not allow you to continue 
  playing at level 2, now you can skip level 2 playing Normally, the mission will be finished 
  at the beginning of level 2 of phase 2 and phase 3, the rest of the levels work normally,
