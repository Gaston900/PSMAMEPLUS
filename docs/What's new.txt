- A definitive solution has been found in the hacks of roms called Version Hybrid Bullets, 
  which has been included in HBMAME around 8 years ago, this rom hacks have a very serious 
  problem that generates a crash in mission 2 / phase 2 and phase 3 , its way of manifesting 
  is to make the torso disappear from the body that if the button is pressed shooting, the game 
  crashes immediately and will restart the game from scratch and will not allow you to continue 
  playing at level 2, now you can skip level 2 playing Normally, the mission will be finished 
  at the beginning of level 2 of phase 2 and phase 3, the rest of the levels work normally, 
  it will no longer be an impediment to continue playing until the end of the game.
